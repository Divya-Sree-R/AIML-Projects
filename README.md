# AIML Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository contains three fundamental Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning projects covering the core verticals:

- Machine Learning (Regression)
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing

Each project is implemented in a clean, notebook-oriented manner with a focus on understanding the core concepts, algorithms, and evaluation methods rather than deployment or production systems.
